# New component instructions

Use this guide for creating a new component for a project. 

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy. Write everything that is needed. 

Your goal is to completely finish whatever the user asks for. 

## Steps

## Requirements

All of my components should be client components.

You'll need to import "use client" at the top of the file.

Make sure to define the interface of the component - i like typescript interfaces
