- [x] `/api/ebay/route.ts` (Completed 2025-03-31)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Created Zod schemas for all input data types
2. Implemented validation in all server actions 
3. Added special handling for FormData validation
4. Implemented API route parameter validation

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified valid inputs are accepted
- Verified invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Confirmed validation doesn't break existing functionality
- Added clear error messages for form validation failures

### Phase 3: Supabase RLS Verification

**Status:** Not Started

**Tables to Verify/Modify:**
- [ ] `items`
- [ ] `profiles`
- [ ] `images`
- [ ] `sold_items`
- [ ] `custom_brands`
- [ ] `custom_franchises`
- [ ] `custom_types`
- [ ] `ebay_history`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Access Supabase dashboard
2. Verify RLS is enabled for each table
3. Create/verify policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
4. Test policies with authenticated and unauthenticated requests

**Testing:**
- Verify direct database access is properly restricted based on user authentication
- Test with authenticated and unauthenticated requests via Supabase client

### Phase 4: API Rate Limiting

**Status:** Not Started

**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `/api/ebay/route.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Install required dependencies
2. Implement rate limiting using Upstash and Vercel KV
3. Configure appropriate rate limits
4. Add error handling for rate limit exceeded

**Testing:**
- Verify legitimate API usage works normally
- Confirm rate limits are enforced when exceeded

### Phase 5: Stripe Payment Link Fix

**Status:** Not Started

**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Convert to client component
2. Use Clerk hooks to get authenticated userId
3. Dynamically construct payment links with client_reference_id
