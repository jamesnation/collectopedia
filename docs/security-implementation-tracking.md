**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Accessed Supabase dashboard
2. Verified RLS is enabled for each table
3. Verified policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
4. Tested policies with authenticated requests

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified all tables have RLS enabled
- Confirmed all tables have proper policies for CRUD operations
- Verified policies correctly use auth.uid() to restrict data access
- All policies are configured with the correct permissions and checks

### Phase 4: API Rate Limiting

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-03-31)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/api/ebay/route.ts` (Completed 2025-03-31)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Installed required dependencies: `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@vercel/kv`
2. Implemented rate limiting using Upstash and Vercel KV
3. Configured rate limits (10 requests per 60 seconds per IP)
4. Added error handling for when rate limit is exceeded
5. Added rate limit headers to all responses

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified legitimate API usage works normally
- Confirmed rate limits are enforced after exceeding the threshold
- Validated rate limit headers are present in responses

### Phase 5: Stripe Payment Link Fix

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Files Verified:**
- [x] `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/stripe-actions.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Verification:**
1. Verified that the pricing page is correctly appending `client_reference_id` to payment links
2. Confirmed the webhook handler properly extracts and uses `client_reference_id` from the session
3. Verified that all required parameters are passed to `updateStripeCustomer`

**Implementation Details:**
- The `PricingCard` component already implements the fix: `finalButtonLink = userId ? ${buttonLink}?client_reference_id=${userId} : buttonLink;`
- The webhook handler correctly uses `checkoutSession.client_reference_id` to update the user's profile
- The server-side `auth()` is already used to get the user ID in the pricing page

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified payment links include client_reference_id for authenticated users
- Confirmed user links redirect to Stripe with the correct parameters
- Ensured the webhook handler correctly processes the checkout session

### Phase 6: Custom Brands Scope Resolution

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Decision Made:** User-Specific (Option A)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `db/queries/custom-brands-queries.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/custom-brands-actions.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Files Verified (No Changes Needed):**
- [x] `actions/custom-franchises-actions.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/custom-types-actions.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)

- [x] `db/queries/custom-types-queries.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Removed the non-user-scoped `getCustomBrands()` function that didn't filter by userId
2. Renamed `getCustomBrandsByUserId()` to `getCustomBrands()` to make it the primary function, maintaining the userId filter
3. Updated import and usage in `custom-brands-actions.ts` to use the renamed function
4. Verified that all custom brands endpoints enforce user-specific scoping
5. Verified that custom-franchises and custom-types implementations already correctly implement user-specific scoping

**Security Changes:**
- Ensured that no global brand fetching function exists
- All brand-related functionality now properly filters by the authenticated user
- Maintained existing authorization checks in update/delete operations
- Added clear comments about security requirements
- Confirmed all custom entity types (brands, franchises, types) are consistently scoped to the authenticated user

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified brands are properly scoped to the authenticated user
- Confirmed existing functionality continues to work correctly
- Ensured no users can access or modify other users' custom brands
- Verified the same level of security is applied to franchises and types
