2. Verified RLS is enabled for each table
3. Verified policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
4. Tested policies with authenticated requests

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified all tables have RLS enabled
- Confirmed all tables have proper policies for CRUD operations
- Verified policies correctly use auth.uid() to restrict data access
- All policies are configured with the correct permissions and checks

### Phase 4: API Rate Limiting

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-03-31)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/api/ebay/route.ts` (Completed 2025-03-31)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Installed required dependencies: `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@vercel/kv`
2. Implemented rate limiting using Upstash and Vercel KV
3. Configured rate limits (10 requests per 60 seconds per IP)
4. Added error handling for when rate limit is exceeded
5. Added rate limit headers to all responses

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified legitimate API usage works normally
- Confirmed rate limits are enforced after exceeding the threshold
- Validated rate limit headers are present in responses

### Phase 5: Stripe Payment Link Fix

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Files Verified:**
- [x] `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/stripe-actions.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Verification:**
1. Verified that the pricing page is correctly appending `client_reference_id` to payment links
2. Confirmed the webhook handler properly extracts and uses `client_reference_id` from the session
3. Verified that all required parameters are passed to `updateStripeCustomer`

**Implementation Details:**
- The `PricingCard` component already implements the fix: `finalButtonLink = userId ? ${buttonLink}?client_reference_id=${userId} : buttonLink;`
- The webhook handler correctly uses `checkoutSession.client_reference_id` to update the user's profile
- The server-side `auth()` is already used to get the user ID in the pricing page

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified payment links include client_reference_id for authenticated users
- Confirmed user links redirect to Stripe with the correct parameters
- Ensured the webhook handler correctly processes the checkout session

### Phase 6: Custom Brands Scope Resolution

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Decision Made:** User-Specific (Option A)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `db/queries/custom-brands-queries.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/custom-brands-actions.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Files Verified (No Changes Needed):**
- [x] `actions/custom-franchises-actions.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)
- [x] `actions/custom-types-actions.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)
- [x] `db/queries/custom-franchises-queries.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)
- [x] `db/queries/custom-types-queries.ts` (Verified 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Removed the non-user-scoped `getCustomBrands()` function that didn't filter by userId
2. Renamed `getCustomBrandsByUserId()` to `getCustomBrands()` to make it the primary function, maintaining the userId filter
3. Updated import and usage in `custom-brands-actions.ts` to use the renamed function
4. Verified that all custom brands endpoints enforce user-specific scoping
5. Verified that custom-franchises and custom-types implementations already correctly implement user-specific scoping

**Security Changes:**
- Ensured that no global brand fetching function exists
- All brand-related functionality now properly filters by the authenticated user
- Maintained existing authorization checks in update/delete operations
- Added clear comments about security requirements
- Confirmed all custom entity types (brands, franchises, types) are consistently scoped to the authenticated user

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified brands are properly scoped to the authenticated user
- Confirmed existing functionality continues to work correctly
- Ensured no users can access or modify other users' custom brands
- Verified the same level of security is applied to franchises and types

### Phase 7: User Data Deletion Completion

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `actions/delete-user-data.ts` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Reviewed the database schema to identify all tables containing user-specific data
2. Updated `deleteUserDataAction` to handle all user-related tables in the database:
   - Added deletion of user profile data (`profilesTable`)
   - Added deletion of all user images (`imagesTable`)
   - Added deletion of all sold items history (`soldItemsTable`)
   - Added deletion of all eBay price history (`ebayHistoryTable`)
3. Maintained transaction-based deletion to ensure atomicity
4. Enhanced the function documentation to clearly indicate all data types being deleted
5. Kept existing authentication and path revalidation logic

**Security Improvements:**
- Ensures complete removal of all user data for privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA)
- Eliminates risk of orphaned records when a user requests deletion
- Provides comprehensive "right to be forgotten" implementation
- Maintains the use of transactions for data consistency

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified all user data is properly deleted from all tables
- Confirmed the transaction rollback works if any deletion fails
- Ensured no orphaned records remain after deletion

### Phase 8: HTTP Security Headers

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `next.config.mjs` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Defined comprehensive security headers configuration with detailed comments
2. Added the following security headers to all routes:
   - `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS with a 2-year duration
   - `X-Content-Type-Options` - Prevents MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities
   - `X-Frame-Options` - Prevents clickjacking by disallowing framing
   - `Referrer-Policy` - Controls referrer information for privacy
   - `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
   - `Permissions-Policy` - Disables sensitive device features
3. Configured Content Security Policy (CSP) with appropriate directives:
   - Allowed scripts from Clerk, Stripe, and Vercel
   - Allowed images from Supabase, Clerk, Stripe, and eBay
   - Restricted all other resources to appropriate origins
   - Set appropriate connect-src for API communications
4. Implemented formatting to ensure clean header output

**Security Improvements:**
- Protects against protocol downgrade attacks with HSTS
- Mitigates XSS and other injection attacks with CSP
- Prevents clickjacking attacks with X-Frame-Options
- Reduces information leakage with referrer policy
- Adds defense-in-depth against various attacks
- Restricts unnecessary browser features with permissions policy

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified headers are properly applied using browser developer tools
- Confirmed application functions correctly with security headers applied
- Validated CSP allows all legitimate resources while blocking unauthorized ones

### Phase 9: Minor Configuration Fixes

**Status:** Completed ✅ (2025-04-01)

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `next.config.mjs` (Completed 2025-04-01)

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. Identified legitimate image sources used in the application:
   - Supabase storage bucket for user-uploaded images
   - eBay for product images
   - Clerk for user authentication images
   - Stripe for payment-related images
2. Updated the `remotePatterns` configuration to restrict hostname access:
   - Replaced overly permissive pattern (`hostname: '**'`) with specific hostnames
   - Added descriptive comments for each hostname
3. Maintained HTTPS protocol requirement for all image sources

**Security Improvements:**
- Prevents abuse of Next.js image optimization service as an open proxy
- Restricts image processing to only trusted, necessary domains
- Reduces potential bandwidth and resource consumption from unauthorized sources
- Mitigates potential security risks from proxying arbitrary content
- Maintains compatibility with all application features

**Testing Verification:**
- Verified images from Supabase storage load correctly
- Confirmed eBay product images render properly
- Tested with Clerk user avatars to ensure they display
- Validated that Stripe images appear as expected
- Ensured application functionality is maintained with restricted image sources
