# Item Details Page Refactoring.

This folder contains the refactored implementation of the Item Details page. The original monolithic component has been broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Folder Structure

- `/context` - Context providers for state that needs to be shared across components
- `/hooks` - Custom hooks for managing state and side effects
- `/ui` - UI components that make up the Item Details page
- `/utils` - Utility functions for the Item Details page
- `index.tsx` - Main entry point that composes the page from the components

## Implementation Overview

The refactoring followed these principles:

1. **Separation of concerns** - Business logic is separated from UI code
2. **Reusability** - Components are designed to be reusable where possible
3. **Maintainability** - Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and maintain
4. **Performance** - Using custom hooks helps optimize rendering

## Refactoring Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
- Created a backup file (item-details-page.bak.20240624.tsx) before making changes
- Created this README file to document the approach

### Phase 2: Structure Creation
- Created appropriate folder structure
- Extracted UI components to their own files
- Extracted business logic to custom hooks
- Implemented consistent prop interfaces

### Phase 3: Integration âœ…
- Integrated all components with their respective hooks
- Connected the real hook implementations to the index.tsx file
- Fixed prop type issues between components
- Ensured all functionality works as expected
